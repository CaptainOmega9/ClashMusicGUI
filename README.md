# Corporate Clash Resource Pack Editor
Tool to assist resource pack creators with Music.json

The source code is publicly available for contributions, but if you do not intend on contributing, I recommend you download the pre-built [installers](https://github.com/OpenToontownTools/ClashMusicGUI/releases)
(The installer will eventually be replaced with an Open Toontown Tools launcher which includes auto updating and will be a hub for all Open Toontown Tools applications)
